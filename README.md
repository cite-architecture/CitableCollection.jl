# CitableCollection.jl

A Julia module for working with collections of citable objects.

## Roadmap to 1.0 release

See milestones in the issue tracker for more detailed lists of issues to resolve for each release.

- **v0.4.x**: complete rewrite using `TypedTables` for underlying data manipulation, and fully implementing behaviors for citable objects and citable collections specified in the `CitableBase` package
- **1.0.0**: complete validation of all CEX blocks contributing to a collection; recognition, manipulation and retrieval of range references; navigation functions for naturally ordered collections.
